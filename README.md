# Can AI Show Creativity in Mathematics? 

We need to be creative to generate new ideas. By dwelling in the gap between what is known and unknown, we place ourselves in an environment that fosters creativity and may enable us to achieve results beyond the reach of AI models.

## 1 Why and How to be Creative

We know that our creativity and discoveries originate in a part of our heads called the brain. So, if we want to conduct research, we need to leverage the brain’s full potential. Why are some people more creative? Why was Einstein so creative?

Not all of us have identical brains; even though our brain structures are the same and we are born with approximately 86 billion neurons, our brains are wired differently, resulting in unique connections (synapses). Some people are more cautious, while others are more adventurous—traits that can be observed just weeks after birth.

Genetics also influences our potential; some of us are genetically predisposed to slightly faster processing speeds, more efficient memory circuitry, and being more prone to anxiety or having a more resilient mood.

So even though we have the same brain with the same structure, they are wired differently. Environment and experience can have a crucial impact on our brains. Our brains have a mechanics that allow our brain to adapt when we gain knowledge or skills, encounter something new, or experience profound emotions like awe or grief. This mechanism of the brain is called neuroplasticity.

Some important facts about neuroplasticity are:
- The brain strengthens the connections that are used frequently, and the reverse of this is also true, that is, the brain prunes away connections that are not used, so “use it or lose it”.
- A child raised in an environment of love and rich language will develop a network of connections, while a child who is neglected, malnourished, or experienced trauma has a different network of connections.
- Learning also changes your brain. When you learn mathematics, your prefrontal cortex builds stronger connections.

Thus, if we have a great environment, opportunities to learn new things, good genetics, and a brain rich in neurons and synapses, it increases the likelihood of being creative. However, these are not necessary conditions. Many creative individuals, such as Einstein, lacked some of these factors, yet their creativity led to groundbreaking discoveries that changed human understanding.

We cannot change the past, our genetics, or many other factors that influence creativity. However, we will discuss how to position ourselves intellectually—like Einstein—so that as our brain creates new neurons and neural pathways, these changes enhance our creativity and lead to groundbreaking discoveries, and so we may reach results that AI cannot reach.

In the following, we first define creativity. Then, as we consider AI as a probabilistic decision maker, we present anecdotes from the history of mathematics to illustrate how certain ideas—born from human creativity—emerge in ways that AI might not be able to obtain.
